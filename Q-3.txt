For three points to be collinear, they must lie on the same straight line.

Given the points (1,1) and (2,2), it can be seen that the line passing through these points is y = x, as for each point, the y-coordinate is equal to the x-coordinate.

Therefore, for any point (x, y) to be collinear with these two points, it must also satisfy this equation. So, any point of the form (n, n) where n is a real number, will be collinear with the points (1,1) and (2,2).

For example, the points (3,3), (4,4), or (5,5) would be collinear with (1,1) and (2,2).
